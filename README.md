# Road-Accident-Dashboard-Analysis ðŸ“Š


In this project, I have created a comprehensive dashboard that analyzes ðŸš—road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. The primary focus is on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total casualties and total accidents for the current year, along with Year-over-Year (YoY) growth comparisons. 
Additionally, I have included KPIs for total casualties by accident severity and vehicle type for the current year.

The dashboardðŸ“Š provides valuable insights into the monthly trends of casualties, comparing the current year with the previous year. It also showcases casualties categorized by road type, location and time of day (day or night), and total casualties and accidents by location. These insights can help stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve road safety.

I utilized Power BI to create an interactive and user-friendly interface, allowing stakeholders to explore the data through visually appealing visualizations and filters. The dashboard presents the data in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand and derive actionable insights.

**Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation**

- Gather Road Accident Data: Collect road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. This data could come from official sources, such as government transportation departments or traffic safety organizations.

- Data Format: Ensure the data is structured in a suitable format, with relevant columns like accident date, accident severity, vehicle type, road type, location, time of day, and casualties.

- Data Cleaning: Clean the data by addressing missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. This step is crucial to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.

**Step 2: Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

- Identify KPIs: Define the key metrics you want to focus on, such as total casualties, total accidents, casualties by accident severity, and casualties by vehicle type.

- Year-over-Year Comparison: Calculate the Year-over-Year growth for total casualties and total accidents between 2021 and 2022.

**Step 3: Creating the Dashboard in Power BI**

- Import Data: Load the cleaned data into Power BI using appropriate connectors (e.g., CSV, Excel, or database connectors).

- Data Modeling: Design a data model by establishing relationships between relevant tables, such as connecting accident data with casualty data.

- Visualizations: Create a variety of visualizations using Power BI's drag-and-drop interface. For KPIs, use card visuals to display total casualties and accidents for the current year, as well as YoY growth.

- Filter Functionality: Implement filters to allow users to interactively filter data based on various parameters like accident severity, vehicle type, road type, and location.

**Step 4: Monthly Trends Analysis**

- Monthly Trends: Use line or column charts to display the monthly trends of casualties for both 2021 and 2022. This comparison helps stakeholders identify any patterns or anomalies.
Step 5: Detailed Insights Visualizations

- Categorization Analysis: Create visuals that categorize casualties based on road type, location, and time of day (day or night). Pie charts or bar charts could effectively illustrate this information.

-Geospatial Insights: Utilize maps to showcase the geographical distribution of total casualties and accidents. This could be done using heatmaps or location pins.

**Step 6: User Interactivity and Exploration**

- User-Friendly Interface: Organize the dashboard layout to present information logically and aesthetically. Place visuals in a way that guides users through the analysis process.

- Drill-Down Functionality: Implement drill-down features, enabling users to click on elements within visuals to explore deeper insights, like clicking on a specific month to see daily casualties.

**Step 7: Finalizing and Sharing the Dashboard**

- Review and Testing: Thoroughly review the dashboard to ensure accuracy, correct data relationships, and functionality of filters and interactions.

- Presentation Mode: Utilize Power BI's presentation mode to showcase the dashboard in a full-screen, engaging manner.

- Sharing: Publish the dashboard to the Power BI service, allowing stakeholders to access it remotely. You can also share it through embedding or distributing secure links.

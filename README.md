# Road-Accident-Dashboard-Analysis


In this project, I have created a comprehensive dashboard that analyzes ðŸš—road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. The primary focus is on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total casualties and total accidents for the current year, along with Year-over-Year (YoY) growth comparisons. 
Additionally, I have included KPIs for total casualties by accident severity and vehicle type for the current year.

The dashboardðŸ“Š provides valuable insights into the monthly trends of casualties, comparing the current year with the previous year. It also showcases casualties categorized by road type, location and time of day (day or night), and total casualties and accidents by location. These insights can help stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve road safety.

I utilized Power BI to create an interactive and user-friendly interface, allowing stakeholders to explore the data through visually appealing visualizations and filters. The dashboard presents the data in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand and derive actionable insights.
